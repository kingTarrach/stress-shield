# Stress Shield App

## One-sentence description of the project

The Stress Shield App will provide stress training and real-time stress data to first-responders like policemen, frontline healthcare workers, and firefighters to help them combat their stress. 

## Additional information about the project

The application will help first responders combat their stress in two main ways - a stress resillience course and tracking of their stress data through a wearable device. The stress resillience course will take users through a medically guided course in easy, digestable bites of information. It will provide the necessary training first-responders need in order to manage their stress while being designed in a way to mimic social media's addictiveness. This way, we can retain high attention rates while also supplying first responders with their personal "shield" against stress. The tracking of their stress data will also be used in tangent with the course to inform the user with how their stress journey is going. This can also be used to see if they will need additional help from places outside the app like therapy or support groups.
